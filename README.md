# 100 Days of Python

I've decided to complete a Udemy course by Dr. Angela Yu Called: 
"100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" 
to become a Python developer in about 3 months.

Here I'm gonna store every day's results for my future employers and myself.

Todays is 8th of June 2022. The War is still outside, no time to waste)))
